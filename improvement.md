# Yagent improvement roadmap

Consolidated, prioritized plan for post-M6 work. Status: **P0 and P1 complete** —
the remaining items are P2/deferred.

Legend: ✅ shipped · 🟡 queued · ⚪ not a fit for a local-first tool.

## P0 — done this pass

- ✅ **Web search provider fallback chain** — `web_search` now tries
  DDG → Mojeek → SearXNG (when configured) on error/empty results. SearXNG as
  the *primary* never falls back to third parties (privacy). (`internal/web`)
- ✅ **Sensitive-data redaction** — API keys, bearer tokens, `key=value`
  secrets and home paths are scrubbed before anything is written to SQLite
  (messages, summaries, semantic memories). (`internal/scrub`)
- ✅ **Tool-call JSON repair heuristic** — `decodeArgs` runs a repair pass
  (trailing commas, raw newlines inside strings) before failing, so minor
  small-model JSON slips don't burn a retry turn. (`internal/tools`)

## P1 — next pass

- ✅ Tree-sitter language expansion: Rust / C / C++ / Java grammars (YAML and
  Markdown already get the line-window fallback).
- ✅ Session forking: `yagent chat --fork <id>` branches a session's history so
  experiments don't mutate the original.
- ✅ Startup re-index: at session start, if an index exists, `Index()` runs in
  the background and hash-checks files, re-embedding only the changed ones
  (the first build stays an explicit `index_repo`).
- ✅ Real versioning (`git describe` via `make build`) instead of `v0.0.0`;
  added a `Makefile` (`make build|test|vet|race|version`).
- ✅ Dynamic tool-schema filtering: the core tool set is always offered; web /
  index / `skill_manage` schemas are added only when the input signals that
  domain or the model already used them this turn. Filtering shrinks what the
  model *sees* (saves ~1k tokens/turn); the registry still holds every tool,
  so a tool the model calls anyway still works.
- ✅ TUI diff overlay: `fs_edit`/`fs_write` approval prompts render a colorized
  before/after diff instead of raw argument JSON.
- ✅ Shell completions: `yagent completion bash|zsh` emits a completion script
  for `chat|sessions|skills|doctor`.

## P2 — deferred / gated

- ✅ Loop mode (M6.13): `yagent chat --goal "..."` / `/goal <text>` runs the
  agent toward a goal in DONE/CONTINUE rounds (capped by `--rounds`, default 8).
  This is also the natural M7 evidence: run an autonomous goal and watch whether
  the single loop bottlenecks.
- ✅ `consult` tool (M6.13): a second local "advisor" model (`consult.server_url`
  / `consult.model`) the agent can ask for a second opinion.
- 🟡 Subagent primitive (`SpawnSubagent`) — M7 proper. Gated: only start if the
  loop-mode evals show the single loop is the bottleneck.
- 🟡 More eval coverage (TUI/verification flows) + benchmarks for chunker and
  hybrid search.
- ⚪ Telemetry / metrics / Docker / systemd / man pages / docs site / CI —
  not a fit for a local-first single binary; would add surface and, for
  telemetry, conflict with the privacy stance.
