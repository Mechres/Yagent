# Yagent improvement roadmap

Consolidated, prioritized plan for post-M6 work. Status: **P0 and P1 complete** —
the remaining items are P2/deferred.

Legend: ✅ shipped · 🟡 queued · ⚪ not a fit for a local-first tool.

## P0 — done this pass

- ✅ **Web search provider fallback chain** — `web_search` now tries
  DDG → Mojeek → SearXNG (when configured) on error/empty results. SearXNG as
  the *primary* never falls back to third parties (privacy). (`internal/web`)
- ✅ **Sensitive-data redaction** — API keys, bearer tokens, `key=value`
  secrets and home paths are scrubbed before anything is written to SQLite
  (messages, summaries, semantic memories). (`internal/scrub`)
- ✅ **Tool-call JSON repair heuristic** — `decodeArgs` runs a repair pass
  (trailing commas, raw newlines inside strings) before failing, so minor
  small-model JSON slips don't burn a retry turn. (`internal/tools`)

## P1 — next pass

- ✅ Tree-sitter language expansion: Rust / C / C++ / Java grammars (YAML and
  Markdown already get the line-window fallback).
- ✅ Session forking: `yagent chat --fork <id>` branches a session's history so
  experiments don't mutate the original.
- ✅ Startup re-index: at session start, if an index exists, `Index()` runs in
  the background and hash-checks files, re-embedding only the changed ones
  (the first build stays an explicit `index_repo`).
- ✅ Real versioning (`git describe` via `make build`) instead of `v0.0.0`;
  added a `Makefile` (`make build|test|vet|race|version`).
- ✅ Dynamic tool-schema filtering: the core tool set is always offered; web /
  index / `skill_manage` schemas are added only when the input signals that
  domain or the model already used them this turn. Filtering shrinks what the
  model *sees* (saves ~1k tokens/turn); the registry still holds every tool,
  so a tool the model calls anyway still works.
- ✅ TUI diff overlay: `fs_edit`/`fs_write` approval prompts render a colorized
  before/after diff instead of raw argument JSON.
- ✅ Shell completions: `yagent completion bash|zsh` emits a completion script
  for `chat|sessions|skills|doctor`.

## P2 — deferred / gated

- ✅ Loop mode (M6.13): `yagent chat --goal "..."` / `/goal <text>` runs the
  agent toward a goal in DONE/CONTINUE rounds (capped by `--rounds`, default 8).
  This is also the natural M7 evidence: run an autonomous goal and watch whether
  the single loop bottlenecks.
- ✅ `consult` tool (M6.13): a second local "advisor" model (`consult.server_url`
  / `consult.model`), a cloud OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`consult.api_key`), or
  an installed terminal AI app (`consult.cmd`, e.g. `[claude, -p]`).
- ✅ Session mgmt (M6.15): `yagent sessions search <q>` + `yagent sessions
  export <id>`.
- ✅ `/undo` (M6.15): in-memory per-turn file-write buffer; reverts the last
  turn's fs_write/fs_edit (incl. created files).
- ✅ Symbol-aware search (M6.15): top-level decls indexed into `index_symbols`;
  `index_search` supports `symbol:`/`type:` exact lookups.
- ✅ Chunker grammars for bash/html/css (M6.16); SQL stays on the line-window
  fallback (its tree-sitter grammar isn't fetchable).
- ✅ Goal-mode eval + chunker/symbol/search benchmarks (M6.16).
- ✅ Sandboxed shell (M6.17): `shell.sandbox: bwrap` wraps `shell_exec` in
  bubblewrap (workspace rw, system ro, private /tmp, no network). It exists to
  contain *consented-but-unsafe* work under `--yolo` on untrusted repos, not to
  replace the approval gate. Fails loudly when bubblewrap is missing (Linux
  only).
- ✅ Multi-user (M6.18): per-project config (`.yagent/config.yaml`), project
  memory (`scope: global|project`), `yagent init`, `yagent backup`,
  `yagent skills import <url>`, repo hygiene (LICENSE/CONTRIBUTING/CHANGELOG/
  example config/CI), expanded doctor, export redaction warnings.
- ✅ M7 v1 started (M6.19): `subagent` tool (isolated read-only child agent),
  `fs_patch` (multi-file unified diff, undo-aware), background jobs
  (`shell_bg`/`shell_logs`/`shell_kill`), `code_outline` (declaration
  signatures), compact code injection, TUI `/sessions` browser.
- ✅ M7 v2: parallel `subagent tasks[]` (each subtask in its own isolated
  read-only child agent, results combined in order).
- 🟡 M7 beyond v2: richer orchestration (tool subsets per subagent, results
  feeding back into the parent). Only if eval evidence shows the single loop
  is the bottleneck.
- 🟡 More eval coverage (TUI/verification flows) + benchmarks for chunker and
  hybrid search.
- ⚪ Telemetry / metrics / Docker / systemd / man pages / docs site —
  not a fit for a local-first single binary; would add surface and, for
  telemetry, conflict with the privacy stance. (CI shipped in M6.18 —
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs gofmt/vet/test/race on every push.)
