# Yagent improvement roadmap

Consolidated, prioritized plan for post-M6 work. Status: **P0 and P1 complete** —
the remaining items are P2/deferred.

Legend: ✅ shipped · 🟡 queued · ⚪ not a fit for a local-first tool.

## P0 — done this pass

- ✅ **Web search provider fallback chain** — `web_search` now tries
  DDG → Mojeek → SearXNG (when configured) on error/empty results. SearXNG as
  the *primary* never falls back to third parties (privacy). (`internal/web`)
- ✅ **Sensitive-data redaction** — API keys, bearer tokens, `key=value`
  secrets and home paths are scrubbed before anything is written to SQLite
  (messages, summaries, semantic memories). (`internal/scrub`)
- ✅ **Tool-call JSON repair heuristic** — `decodeArgs` runs a repair pass
  (trailing commas, raw newlines inside strings) before failing, so minor
  small-model JSON slips don't burn a retry turn. (`internal/tools`)

## P1 — next pass

- ✅ Tree-sitter language expansion: Rust / C / C++ / Java grammars (YAML and
  Markdown already get the line-window fallback).
- ✅ Session forking: `yagent chat --fork <id>` branches a session's history so
  experiments don't mutate the original.
- ✅ Startup re-index: at session start, if an index exists, `Index()` runs in
  the background and hash-checks files, re-embedding only the changed ones
  (the first build stays an explicit `index_repo`).
- ✅ Real versioning (`git describe` via `make build`) instead of `v0.0.0`;
  added a `Makefile` (`make build|test|vet|race|version`).
- ✅ Dynamic tool-schema filtering: the core tool set is always offered; web /
  index / `skill_manage` schemas are added only when the input signals that
  domain or the model already used them this turn. Filtering shrinks what the
  model *sees* (saves ~1k tokens/turn); the registry still holds every tool,
  so a tool the model calls anyway still works.
- ✅ TUI diff overlay: `fs_edit`/`fs_write` approval prompts render a colorized
  before/after diff instead of raw argument JSON.
- ✅ Shell completions: `yagent completion bash|zsh` emits a completion script
  for `chat|sessions|skills|doctor`.

## P2 — deferred / gated

- ✅ Loop mode (M6.13): `yagent chat --goal "..."` / `/goal <text>` runs the
  agent toward a goal in DONE/CONTINUE rounds (capped by `--rounds`, default 8).
  This is also the natural M7 evidence: run an autonomous goal and watch whether
  the single loop bottlenecks.
- ✅ `consult` tool (M6.13): a second local "advisor" model (`consult.server_url`
  / `consult.model`), a cloud OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`consult.api_key`), or
  an installed terminal AI app (`consult.cmd`, e.g. `[claude, -p]`).
- ✅ Session mgmt (M6.15): `yagent sessions search <q>` + `yagent sessions
  export <id>`.
- ✅ `/undo` (M6.15): in-memory per-turn file-write buffer; reverts the last
  turn's fs_write/fs_edit (incl. created files).
- ✅ Symbol-aware search (M6.15): top-level decls indexed into `index_symbols`;
  `index_search` supports `symbol:`/`type:` exact lookups.
- ✅ Chunker grammars for bash/html/css (M6.16); SQL stays on the line-window
  fallback (its tree-sitter grammar isn't fetchable).
- ✅ Goal-mode eval + chunker/symbol/search benchmarks (M6.16).
- ✅ Sandboxed shell (M6.17): `shell.sandbox: bwrap` wraps `shell_exec` in
  bubblewrap (workspace rw, system ro, private /tmp, no network). It exists to
  contain *consented-but-unsafe* work under `--yolo` on untrusted repos, not to
  replace the approval gate. Fails loudly when bubblewrap is missing (Linux
  only).
- ✅ Multi-user (M6.18): per-project config (`.yagent/config.yaml`), project
  memory (`scope: global|project`), `yagent init`, `yagent backup`,
  `yagent skills import <url>`, repo hygiene (LICENSE/CONTRIBUTING/CHANGELOG/
  example config/CI), expanded doctor, export redaction warnings.
- ✅ M7 v1 started (M6.19): `subagent` tool (isolated read-only child agent),
  `fs_patch` (multi-file unified diff, undo-aware), background jobs
  (`shell_bg`/`shell_logs`/`shell_kill`), `code_outline` (declaration
  signatures), compact code injection, TUI `/sessions` browser.
- ✅ M7 v2: parallel `subagent tasks[]` (each subtask in its own isolated
  read-only child agent, results combined in order).
- ✅ M7 beyond v2: `subagent` gained a `tools[]` subset — each child registry
  is scoped to the requested read-only tools (invalid/destructive requests are
  rejected and fed back), and the child's summary already feeds back into the
  parent as the tool result.
- ✅ M7 beyond v2 (more): shared subagent scratchpad (`scratch_write`/
  `scratch_read` under `.yagent/scratch/`), call-graph `code_references`,
  workspace checkpoints for goal mode (`/checkpoint`), fuzzy tool-argument
  aliasing, and tool-output compaction.
- 🟡 M7 beyond v2 (remaining): deeper orchestration — a shared structured
  memory beyond a string summary (a true subagent workspace), and an
  interactive per-hunk fs_patch approval modal. Only if real use shows the
  summary / atomic approval is the bottleneck.
- 🟡 More eval coverage (TUI/verification flows) + benchmarks for chunker and
  hybrid search.
- ⚪ Telemetry / metrics / Docker / systemd / man pages / docs site —
  not a fit for a local-first single binary; would add surface and, for
  telemetry, conflict with the privacy stance. (CI shipped in M6.18 —
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs gofmt/vet/test/race on every push.)

## Proposed (external agent reviews — not yet scoped/started)

Copilot's "explore-codebase-and-plan-improvements" plan (2026-08-11). Ideas
only; status notes reflect what already exists so they can be evaluated on top
of reality:

- 🟡 **Structured subagent workspace** (M7 "deeper orchestration"). Upgrade
  subagent output from plain summary text to shared structured artifacts
  (task id, type, payload, provenance, confidence). Suggested trimmed scope:
  add `return_artifacts` to the subagent tool — the child lists which scratch
  notes are its results, and the parent's result comes back structured instead
  of free-text. Backward compatible with existing subagent/scratch behavior.
  *Already present:* scratchpad (`scratch_write`/`scratch_read`), parallel
  `tasks[]` ordering, per-child token tally, tool subsets.
- 🟡 **fs_patch approval UX v2** — true centered modal with file/hunk
  navigation, selection state, select-all/select-none, and a final apply
  summary (vs. today's in-stream per-hunk walker). Partial selection must
  always yield a valid reconstructed patch or an explicit denial.
  *Already present:* per-hunk y/n/q walker + `RebuildPatch` args rewrite.
- 🟡 **Eval + benchmark expansion** — golden evals for structured subagent
  workflows, partial fs_patch approvals, and failure-recovery paths;
  benchmarks for subagent fan-out/fan-in and patch split/rebuild.
  *Already present:* evals for subagent/toolset, fuzzy args, code_references;
  chunker/symbol/hybrid-search benchmarks.

A second external agent's plan (2026-08-11). Its section A (fs_patch modal v2)
was superseded mid-inspection — that work is already shipped (per-hunk walker
+ `RebuildPatch`). Sections B/C/D recorded for evaluation:

### B — quick wins (no new deps, local-first)

- 🟡 **B1 eval-coverage gaps** — golden evals for `/skills verify` PASS/FAIL,
  `/undo` revert, `/checkpoint` save|restore, consult soft-fail, and
  `shell.sandbox: bwrap` loud-deny. Scripted httptest servers, no network.
- 🟡 **B2 `--trace` prompt dump** — `yagent chat --trace <file>` writes each
  assembled context with per-section token estimates (system / L0 / summary /
  recall / code / history). Local file only (fits privacy stance). Acceptance:
  segments sum to `ContextUsage`.
- 🟡 **B3 TUI transcript search** — in-viewport find (Ctrl-/ or similar) that
  jumps to the next match. *Already present:* scrollable viewport.
- 🟡 **B4 config schema completeness** — `consult.cmd` and shell/job timeouts
  aren't editable via `/set`; expose missing keys (with choosers where apt) so
  `/settings` is the single surface. Acceptance: `/set consult.cmd [...]`
  round-trips and reloads.

### C — capability features (medium effort)

- 🟡 **C1 accurate token counting via `/tokenize`** — `llm.CountTokens()` calls
  the server's tokenizer when exposed, falling back to len/4; wire into
  `estTokensLocked`/`ContextUsage` so the gauge and summarization trigger are
  accurate. *Note:* dev llama.cpp `llama-server` exposes `POST /tokenize` at
  the root, so C1 is feasible on :8089 without a workaround.
- 🟡 **C2 goal-mode resume across restarts** — wire `RunGoal` to the checkpoint
  store so each round auto-saves and `--resume-goal` continues. *Already
  present:* pre-goal snapshot (`/checkpoint restore goal`).
- 🟡 **C3 subagent structured returns** — children return structured JSON
  (findings + paths + confidence) the parent can index/act on, plus a shared
  read-only subagent workspace. Gated: only if string-summary is the real
  bottleneck. (Same target as the Copilot artifact item above.)

### D — out of scope (local-first / privacy)

Telemetry/metrics, Docker/systemd units, man pages, docs site, embedded
inference, MCP client, cloud provider SDKs (CI already ships).
